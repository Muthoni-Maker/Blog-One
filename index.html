            <h2>Hidden Gem</h2>
            <p>Were are born for a purpose.We are born to win and enact change on the face of 
                the earth.But the only thing that seperates winners from loosers is our believes and the willingness 
                to utilise chances and opportunitie available to us.Being curios and willing to learn from 
                one another is what makes the huge difference between change makers and people who just wait for
                change to happen on them without putting any effort.Every human being has the capability to be great.
                There is that power within us that is hidden, but only the courageus ones manages to discover and make 
                use of it.All it requires is the litle effort to try.Referencing to the Born A crime novel by Trevor Noah,
                the hidden gem in us only becomes valuable once we become aware of ourselves.Trevor Noah was aware of his
                strengths and talents and that what contributed to him being successful in his comedy career.We are a hidden 
                gem.There is that power within us that makes each one of us unique.And self awareness is that one thing that willing
                help unvail the gem in us and become impactfull.

                 all it requires is the right attitude and willingness to try.Covid19 is a novel that has affected
                 the entire world.We all have been entangled in this one cacoon of a disastrous and chaotic
                 moments leaving a majority of us in an awe moment.But that does not bring the life journey to a halt thus 
                 leaving us with no choice but to embrace the situation and improvise on making it bright.As youths We
                 occupy the biggest percentantage of the world's population.This gives us not only the power to lead but also 
                 to be impactful in a postive manner.And during this moments with are the strong generation that is resillien
                 enough to keep everyone on their toes as well as add taste to life.Activities such as online webinars are that 
                 one thing we as youth can make us to spread hope and encourage everyone to remain strong during this
                 time.
